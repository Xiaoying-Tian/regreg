The RegReg project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RegReg is a simple multi-algorithm framework for prototyping and solving regularized regression problems. The goal is to enable practitioners to quickly experiment with a variety of different models and choices of regularization. In that spirit, the emphasis is on the flexibility of the framework instead of computational speed for any particular problem.

For a quick introduction, take a look at the :ref:`tutorial` and the :ref:`gallery`.

For more details, see the :ref:`algorithms` page.

See :ref:`agenda` for development goals.
