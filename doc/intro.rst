The RegReg project
~~~~~~~

RegReg is a simple multi-algorithm framework for prototyping and solving regularized regression problems. The goal is to enable practitioners to quickly experiment with a variety of different models and choices of regularization. In that spirit, the emphasis is on the flexibility of the framework instead of computational speed for any particular problem.

(TODO: describe basic problem)
